This repository converts "ESP-WROOM-02" module to 2.54 mm pitch.  
I am assuming to use on a solderless breadboard.

### This Repo... Empty??? ###
  
I am currently manufacturing the board.  
All files are added as soon as normal operation can be confirmed.
  
(I am waiting for luggage from Elecrow.)
